# Heart-Diseases-Prediction-Model

## Description
In this project,we would like to develop a machine learning model to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on a specific dataset.The supervised machine learning algorithm we are using are:
  K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN)
  Decision Tree
  Support Vector Machine(SVM)
